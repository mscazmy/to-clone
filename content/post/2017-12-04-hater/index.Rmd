## The Premise

Using data from the new-age dating app, [Hater](www.haterdater.com), we can learn about the types of things that people in the US love, hate, and can never agree on. 

## My Contributions

* Data Analysis
* Story Writing
* Some front-end work (primarily the swarm chart)
* Static chart design
* Social image creation

## Collaborators

This project was done in collaboration with [Russell Goldenberg](https://twitter.com/codenberg) at [The Pudding](www.pudding.cool). Russell took the design-lead for this piece, and also was responsible for the front-end development of the small multiple graphics and the maps.
