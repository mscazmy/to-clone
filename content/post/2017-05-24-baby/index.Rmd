## The Premise

Every time there is some sort of large scale storm (e.g., blizzard or hurricane) or big sports win, I seem to hear everyone chatting about how there will be a baby boom in that area 9 months later. Driven by the curiosity to see if there was any data to back up these claims, I decided to investigate a little further. This project tells the story of my findings while allowing readers to play with the interactive graphic to answer their own questions. 

## My Contributions

* Project Design
* Majority of Front-End Development (HTML, CSS, and D3)
* Story Writing

## Collaborators

This project was done in collaboration with the fine folks at [The Pudding](www.pudding.cool). Specifically, [Matt Daniels](https://twitter.com/matthew_daniels) who helped me shape the story, make this piece mobile friendly, and fix some of my beginner-coding bugs, and [Russell Goldenberg](https://twitter.com/codenberg) who helped optimize my code.

If you don't want to be told where to look, you can go rogue and explore within the graphic at any time."}
