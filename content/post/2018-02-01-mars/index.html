<div id="the-premise" class="section level2">
<h2>The Premise</h2>
<p>I discovered that the <a href="https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/">Curiosity Rover</a> transmitted weather data (amongst other types of data) back to Earth nearly every day. I decided that in order to have the reader understand what weather conditions are like on Mars, the data needed to be made personal. With Curiosity as my inspiration, I wrote the story from the rover’s perspective in the form of digital “postcards”. After all, the “human tradition” with postcards is to write home while on a long journey and report back on how the “weather is beautiful” and that you wished they were there. Incorporating the reader’s geo-located weather for the day and updating the data daily added more personal elements to this piece.</p>
