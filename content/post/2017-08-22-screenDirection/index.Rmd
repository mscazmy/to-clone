## The Premise

There have been several projects conducted that show a disparity in film dialogue between male and female characters. But, talking isn't the only thing important to a movie. The way characters are instructed to act plays a role as well. In this project, we investigate over 2,000 film scripts to find what verbs are more likely to follow the pronouns "he" and "she".  

## My Contributions

* Some front-end development (HTML, CSS, and D3)

## Collaborators

The data collection, analysis, graphic wireframes, and story-writing for this project came from [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge). [Russell Goldenberg](https://twitter.com/codenberg) designed the page and also performed much of the front-end development.
