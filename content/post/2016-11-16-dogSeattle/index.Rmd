Introduction
------------

This report investigates licensed dog ownership in Seattle, WA (USA).

I'm curious about a few things here:

* People estimate that there are 160,000 dogs in Seattle. Where are they?

* Seattle is a relatively densely-populated area. Are small, apartment-friendly dogs preferred?

* Using this information, what recommendations could be made to aspiring dog sitters and walkers in Seattle?

I will annotate each step of data analysis as I go.

Time to get started!

### Importing Licensed Dog Ownership Data

The spreadsheet containing all licensed dog ownership information was obtained from the Seattle Times article ["Mapping the Dogs of Seattle"](http://www.seattletimes.com/life/pets/mapping-the-dogs-of-seattle/) and is available for [download](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XWLw_hxWM2RHiwALzcM_QxNpzQn_cDmS3Z9HFoZMvTo/edit#gid=460106206). According to the article, the original data were obtained from the Seattle Animal Shelter and represent the 43,000 licensed dogs in Seattle as of February 2015. *Note: This number is thought to only represent approximately [27% of the dog population in Seattle](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/ParksAndRecreation/PoliciesPlanning/Plans/Response_to_SLI_69-1-B-1_(Dog_Off-Leash_Areas).pdf)*

``` r
dogs <- read.csv(file = "Seattle_Dogs_2015.csv", header = TRUE, 
    stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

Great! Let's take a quick look at the data file.

``` r
str(dogs)
```

    ## 'data.frame':    42996 obs. of  7 variables:
    ##  $ License.Type.Sold: Factor w/ 15 levels "Dog 6 Month Prov/Rabies",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 ...
    ##  $ Animal.Type      : Factor w/ 1 level "Dog": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
    ##  $ Gender           : Factor w/ 3 levels "Female","Male",..: 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 ...
    ##  $ Primary.Breed    : Factor w/ 227 levels "Affenpinscher",..: 53 53 174 123 137 102 53 106 26 15 ...
    ##  $ Primary.Color    : Factor w/ 90 levels "","Amber","Apricot",..: 85 6 85 10 10 9 9 36 83 56 ...
    ##  $ Name             : Factor w/ 10712 levels ""," "," Carlota",..: 603 9763 317 1324 3671 5764 6065 4254 490 7006 ...
    ##  $ Zip.C            : Factor w/ 155 levels "","*/116","14534",..: 107 107 100 75 84 1 86 77 107 87 ...

It looks like the variables we are working with right now:

-   **License Type** : Indicates what type of license the dog has
-   **Animal Type** : Since this dataset is all about dogs, there is only one animal type listed: "Dog"
-   **Gender** : Dog's sex ("Male", "Female", or "Unspec")
-   **Primary Breed** : Indicates the general breed of the dog
-   **Primary Color** : Indicates the dog's overall color
-   **Name** : Lists the dog's name
-   **Zip.C** : Indicates the zipcode where the dog is registered

We can eliminate the "Animal Type" column since it doesn't give us any additional information.

``` r
dogs <- dogs %>% select(-2)
```

Ok, now is there anyway to condense or standardize the breeds listed?

Let's take a look at what kind of breeds are present in Seattle.

``` r
levels(dogs$Primary.Breed)
```

Wow! That's quite a few! We'll come back to cleaning up the species names in a bit.

Generally, the dog's estimated size may be more beneficial than their breed, so let's try to pair these data up with information from other sources. The data used are available [here](http://modernpuppies.com/breedweightchart.aspx). Time to import the database of dog breeds with their sizes.

``` r
weight <- read.csv(file = "Breed_Wt.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Now let's see what that looks like.

``` r
str(weight)
```

    ## 'data.frame':    372 obs. of  3 variables:
    ##  $ Breed                 : chr  "Airedoodle" "Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog" "Alaskan Klee Kai" "Alsatian" ...
    ##  $ Average.Adult.Weight  : chr  "Male: 45-65 lbs" "Male: 50-80 lbs" "Male: 11-15 lbs" "Male: 65-85 lbs" ...
    ##  $ Average.Adult.Weight.1: chr  "Female: 45-65 lbs" "Female: 50-80 lbs" "Female: 11-15 lbs" "Female: 50-70 lbs" ...

``` r
head(weight)
```

    ##                        Breed Average.Adult.Weight Average.Adult.Weight.1
    ## 1                 Airedoodle      Male: 45-65 lbs      Female: 45-65 lbs

Cleaning Data
-------------

Looks like lots of character strings. Time to split out some of these columns. We'll use the R packages `tidyr` and `dplyr` for this.

``` r
# Delete empty rows
weight <- weight[!apply(weight == "", 1, all), ]

# Splitting Average Adult Weight (Species with Weight Ranges)
weight_split <- weight %>% separate(Average.Adult.Weight, into = c("Male", 
    "Wt_Range"), sep = ": ") %>% filter(grepl("-", Wt_Range)) %>% 
    separate(Wt_Range, into = c("Min", "Max", "lbs")) %>% select(-lbs) %>% 
    separate(Average.Adult.Weight.1, into = c("Female", "Wt_Range_F"), 
        sep = ": ") %>% filter(grepl("-", Wt_Range_F)) %>% separate(Wt_Range_F, 
    into = c("Min_F", "Max_F", "lbs_F")) %>% mutate_each(funs(as.numeric), 
    (Min:Max)) %>% mutate_each(funs(as.numeric), (Min_F:Max_F)) %>% 
    mutate(Male_Avg = (Min + Max)/2) %>% mutate(Female_Avg = (Min_F + 
    Max_F)/2) %>% select(1, 9:10)

# Splitting Average Adult Weight (no ranges)
weight_split_2 <- weight %>% separate(Average.Adult.Weight, into = c("Male", 
    "Wt_Range"), sep = ": ") %>% filter(!grepl("-", Wt_Range)) %>% 
    separate(Wt_Range, into = c("Male_Avg", "lbs")) %>% separate(Average.Adult.Weight.1, 
    into = c("Female", "Wt_Range_F"), sep = ": ") %>% separate(Wt_Range_F, 
    into = c("Female_Avg", "lbs_2")) %>% select(1, 3, 6)

# Bind Both Data Frames
weight_split_all <- rbind(weight_split_2, weight_split)

# Check out our new dataframe
head(weight_split_all)
```

    ##              Breed Male_Avg Female_Avg
    ## 1     Afghan Hound       60         50
    ## 2 Airedale Terrier       55         55
    ## 3 Alaskan Malamute       85         75
    ## 4          Basenji       24         22
    ## 5  English Bulldog       50         40
    ## 6    Cairn Terrier       14         13

Great! Now we have a dataframe that just lists breed, and then average weight for males and females. Now we can use this to fill in the estimated weight for each of the animals in our `dogs` dataset.

``` r
# Make a copy of our dataset
dogs_2 <- dogs

# Match dog breed from dogs dataset to breed from
# weight_split_all dataset
dogs_2$Male_Avg <- weight_split_all[match(dogs_2$Primary.Breed, 
    weight_split_all$Breed), "Male_Avg"]

dogs_2$Male_Avg <- as.numeric(dogs_2$Male_Avg)

dogs_2$Female_Avg <- weight_split_all[match(dogs_2$Primary.Breed, 
    weight_split_all$Breed), "Female_Avg"]

dogs_2$Female_Avg <- as.numeric(dogs_2$Female_Avg)
```

Great! Let's check how we did.

``` r
summary(dogs_2$Male_Avg)
```

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##    5.00   16.00   52.50   47.53   72.50  182.50   11611

Well, looks like our system automatically placed 73% of our entries, the remaining 27% (or 11,611 dogs) were not found. Let's see if those were all the same or similar species.

``` r
missing_size <- dogs_2 %>% filter(is.na(Male_Avg)) %>% group_by(Primary.Breed) %>% 
    summarise(count = n())

head(missing_size)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 2
    ##                Primary.Breed count
    ##                       <fctr> <int>
    ## 1           Alaskan Malumute   123
    ## 2      Amer. Pitbull Terrier   137
    ## 3        Amer. Water Spaniel     5
    ## 4 Amer.Staffordshire Terrier   186
    ## 5      Appenzel Mountain Dog     3
    ## 6         Australian Shepard  1216

Ah, looks like we have a few misspelled names in our original database. Let's try to clean those up a bit.

Due to the random nature of the misspellings and re-wording of breeds in this dataset, I'll use the `gsub` function to manually recode the ones that need it. This also allows for verification that the correct new term is being used.

That was a lot of very different errors in that dataset! Let's see if that helped.

``` r
# Match dog breed from dogs dataset to breed from
# weight_split_all dataset
dogs_2$Male_Avg <- weight_split_all[match(dogs_2$Primary.Breed, 
    weight_split_all$Breed), "Male_Avg"]

dogs_2$Male_Avg <- as.numeric(dogs_2$Male_Avg)

dogs_2$Female_Avg <- weight_split_all[match(dogs_2$Primary.Breed, 
    weight_split_all$Breed), "Female_Avg"]

dogs_2$Female_Avg <- as.numeric(dogs_2$Female_Avg)
```

Let's see how we did.

``` r
summary(dogs_2$Male_Avg)
```

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##    5.00   15.50   50.00   45.19   72.50  182.50    3503

Well, that did fix some of the missing values! Still another 3,503 (or 8%) to go!

``` r
missing_size_2 <- dogs_2 %>% filter(is.na(Male_Avg)) %>% group_by(Primary.Breed) %>% 
    summarise(count = n())

missing_size_2$Primary.Breed
```

    ##  [1] "Amer. Pitbull Terrier"  "Appenzel Mountain Dog" 
    ##  [3] "Belgian Shepherd"       "Bulldog"               
    ##  [5] "Carolina"               "Cirneco Dell Etna"     
    ##  [7] "Curs"                   "Dingo"                 
    ##  [9] "Entlebucher"            "Formosan Mountain Dog" 
    ## [11] "Hound"                  "Kyi-Leo"               
    ## [13] "Landseer"               "Looks Like"            
    ## [15] "McNab"                  "Mix"                   
    ## [17] "Norwegian Lundehund"    "NULL"                  
    ## [19] "Purebred"               "Saluki"                
    ## [21] "See Notes"              "Shepherd"              
    ## [23] "Silken Windhound"       "Spaniel"               
    ## [25] "Terrier"                "Toy Manchester Terrier"
    ## [27] "Unspecified"            "Welsh Springer Spaniel"
    ## [29] "Wolf Hybrid"            "Xolo"

It looks like a few of these can't be sorted. For example, we have no way of estimating size for "Looks Like", "Mix", "Purebred", "See Notes" or "Unspecified", so I'll make the sizes of all of those "NA".

``` r
dogs_2$Primary.Breed <- gsub("Looks Like|^Mix$|NULL|Purebred|See Notes|Unspecified|^Curs$", 
    NA, dogs_2$Primary.Breed)

# Calculate how many are missing now
missing_size_3 <- dogs_2 %>% filter(is.na(Male_Avg)) %>% group_by(Primary.Breed) %>% 
    summarise(count = n())
```

So of our remaining 3,503 dogs, how many of them have sizes that we can't estimate?

``` r
missing_size_3[which(is.na(missing_size_3)), ]
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 2
    ##   Primary.Breed count
    ##           <chr> <int>
    ## 1          <NA>  1313

We can't estimate 1,313 dogs' sizes, which means that we can still estimate the size of the remaining 2,190 dogs. We only have a few species left, and it looks like they weren't ones that were in our original weights dataset.

``` r
missing_size_3$Primary.Breed
```

    ##  [1] "Amer. Pitbull Terrier"  "Appenzel Mountain Dog" 
    ##  [3] "Belgian Shepherd"       "Bulldog"               
    ##  [5] "Carolina"               "Cirneco Dell Etna"     
    ##  [7] "Dingo"                  "Entlebucher"           
    ##  [9] "Formosan Mountain Dog"  "Hound"                 
    ## [11] "Kyi-Leo"                "Landseer"              
    ## [13] "McNab"                  "Norwegian Lundehund"   
    ## [15] "Saluki"                 "Shepherd"              
    ## [17] "Silken Windhound"       "Spaniel"               
    ## [19] "Terrier"                "Toy Manchester Terrier"
    ## [21] "Welsh Springer Spaniel" "Wolf Hybrid"           
    ## [23] "Xolo"                   NA

Since there are only a few breeds left, I will manually create a database of the average weights (all found on the Wikipedia pages for the species).

I'll upload in the supplemental file and match the breed name and mass.

``` r
# Import File
supp_weight <- read.csv(file = "Supp_Breed_Wt.csv", header = TRUE, 
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Make a copy of our filtered dataset
dogs_3 <- dogs_2 %>% filter(is.na(Male_Avg))

dogs_4 <- dogs_2 %>% filter(!is.na(Male_Avg))

# Match dog breed from dogs dataset to breed from
# weight_split_all dataset
dogs_3$Male_Avg <- supp_weight[match(dogs_3$Primary.Breed, supp_weight$Breed), 
    "Male_Avg"]

dogs_3$Male_Avg <- as.numeric(dogs_3$Male_Avg)

dogs_3$Female_Avg <- supp_weight[match(dogs_3$Primary.Breed, 
    supp_weight$Breed), "Female_Avg"]

dogs_3$Female_Avg <- as.numeric(dogs_3$Female_Avg)

# Bind datasets back together
dogs_5 <- rbind(dogs_3, dogs_4)
```

``` r
summary(dogs_5$Male_Avg)
```

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##    5.00   16.00   50.00   45.77   72.50  182.50    1313

Awesome! So the only dogs that we still don't have approximate weights on are the ones with miscoded breeds. Now let's get a better approximation of weight based on gender.

``` r
dogs_5$Gender <- as.factor(dogs_5$Gender)

dogs_5 <- dogs_5 %>% mutate(weight = ifelse(Gender == "Female", 
    Female_Avg, Male_Avg))
```

Perfect. Now we can make an estimate of how they would be categorized on "[Rover.com](www.rover.com)", a Seattle-based website aimed at helping dog-owners find reliable dog-sitters and walkers. Their website lists the following size cutoffs (in lbs):

* Small = 0 - 15
* Medium = 16 - 40
* Large = 41 - 100
* Giant = 100 +

Let's add those classifications to our dataset.

``` r
dogs_5 <- dogs_5 %>% mutate(size_class = ifelse(weight <= 15, 
    "Small", ifelse(weight > 15 & weight <= 40, "Medium", ifelse(weight > 
        40 & weight <= 100, "Large", ifelse(weight > 100, "Giant", 
        NA)))))

dogs_5$size_class <- as.factor(dogs_5$size_class)
```

Now we've got information on dogs, with their breeds, zipcodes and approximate sizes and size classes. This will help us later.

Data Visualizations
-------------------

### Dog Popularity -- By Breed

Now let's look at some visualizations. We'll start with the popularity of each dog breed within Seattle. This figure shows the top 24 most popular breeds in the city.

![Bar graph showing the most popular dog breeds in Seattle, labradors, chihuahuas, and golden retrievers are the most popular](unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)

Wow! Looks like labrador retrievers are by far the most popular breed of dog in Seattle.

### Dog Popularity -- By Size

How do the numbers of dogs break down by dog size?

![Bar graph showing the most popular dog sizes in Seattle. The highest number of dogs is considered "large", followed by "medium", "small", "giant"](unnamed-chunk-24-1.png)

For a city filled with apartment buildings, Seattle-ites really love large dogs (almost as much as medium and small dogs combined!).

I wonder if this trend varies depending on which part of the city the pets are living in.

### Dog Populations by Zip Code

First let's see the density of dogs living in each zip code. Looks like we have some messy zip code data with quite a few zip codes not falling in the Seattle area. We'll use a list of [Washington State zip codes](http://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/wa/#zips-list) to narrow this list down.

``` r
# Import Zipcode dataset
zipcodes <- read.csv("Zipcodes.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Match zipcodes in database to those listed on dog licenses
dogs_5$zip <- zipcodes[match(dogs_5$Zip.C, zipcodes$ZIP), "ZIP"]

# Make zipcodes factors
dogs_5$zip <- as.factor(dogs_5$zip)

# How many are missing?
sum(is.na(dogs_5$zip))
```

    ## [1] 365

Ok, so there were 365 dog licenses that didn't list appropriate zip codes. That's alright, that's less than 1% of our dataset. Let's move forward.

*It looks like several of the zipcodes listed are "industrial" zip codes. We'll replace the zip code with the residential zip code that each industrial one falls within.*

![Choropleth map showing the dog population in various zip codes throughout Seattle. the highest proportions are in northern Seattle"](unnamed-chunk-26-1.png)

Looks like the highest populations of licensed dogs are found in zipcodes 98115, 98103, and 98117. That corresponds roughly to Northeast Seattle, the area between Fremont and Greenwood, and the Ballard to Crown Hill area. It is certainly possible that the high dog populations in those areas could be correlated with the human population in the same areas. Let's see how many licensed dogs there are per person in these areas.

*Human Population Data Obtained [Here](http://zipatlas.com/us/wa/seattle/zip-code-comparison/population-density.htm)*

``` r
human_pop <- read.csv("Human_Pop.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Make a copy of our dataset (dog populations by zipcode)
pop_zip_2 <- pop_zip

# Match human populations from new dataset to zipcodes from
# dog population dataset
pop_zip_2$h_pop <- human_pop[match(pop_zip_2$region, human_pop$Zip), 
    "Population"]
pop_zip_2$h_pop <- gsub(",", "", pop_zip_2$h_pop)
pop_zip_2$h_pop <- as.numeric(pop_zip_2$h_pop)


# Create new factor: dog_human (i.e. ratio of dogs to humans)
pop_zip_2 <- pop_zip_2 %>% filter(!is.na(h_pop)) %>% filter(h_pop > 
    10) %>% mutate(dog_human = value/h_pop) %>% select(1, 4)

# Change variable names for choroplethrZip
pop_zip_2 <- rename(pop_zip_2, value = dog_human)

# Plot
zip_choropleth(pop_zip_2, zip_zoom = (pop_zip_2$region), legend = "Dog:Human Ratio", 
    reference_map = TRUE, num_colors = 1)
```


![Choropleth map showing the dog population per human in various zip codes throughout Seattle. The highest proportions are in central Seattle"](unnamed-chunk-27-1.png)

Generally speaking, central Seattle has a higher "Licensed Dogs : People" Ratio than the neighborhoods along the north and south edges. The highest proportion is found in zipcode 98117 or the Ballard to Crown Hill area with roughly 1 licensed dog for every 10 people. That is a residential area with lots of homes and fewer apartment buildings than the downtown-area.

I wonder if there are more large dogs in those house-filled areas and small dogs in apartment-laden areas. Let's map dog populations by their size.

These figures will be proportions of small, medium, large and giant dogs in proportion to the number of dogs in each zipcode.

### Dog Populations by Size

#### Small

![Choropleth map showing the small dog population compared to the entire dog population in various zip codes throughout Seattle. the highest proportions are in downtown Seattle"](unnamed-chunk-28-1.png)

#### Medium

![Choropleth map showing the medium dog population compared to the entire dog population in various zip codes throughout Seattle. the highest proportions are in northern Seattle"](unnamed-chunk-29-1.png)

#### Large

### Caveats of Dog Size by Zipcode

Wow! Looks like the largest proportion of small dogs is quite concentrated to zipcodes 98134 (Industrial District) and 98101 (Downtown Seattle, near Pike Place Market). These zip codes do have relatively small total dog populations though, totalling at only 38 and 487 dogs, respectively.

Medium, large and giant sized dogs have a generally more consistent proportional distribution throughout the city. Both medium and large dogs have a higher than average proportion in zip code 98155, but again, this area boasts a small overall dog population (17 dogs total).

### Dog Names

Just for fun, let's take a look at the most popular dog names in Seattle. Word cloud, anyone?

``` r
# Create a corpus
names <- Corpus(VectorSource(dogs_5$Name))

# Convert to plain text document
names <- tm_map(names, PlainTextDocument)

# Remove numbers and punctuation, just in case
names <- tm_map(names, removeNumbers)
names <- tm_map(names, removePunctuation)

# Make all names lowercase
names <- tm_map(names, content_transformer(tolower))


# Generate the wordcloud
wordcloud(names, scale = c(5, 0.2), max.words = 150, random.order = FALSE, 
    rot.per = 0.35, use.r.layout = TRUE, colors = brewer.pal(6, 
        "Greens")[c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)])
```

![Word cloud of dog names. Some of the largest include Lucy, Charlie, Null, Daisy, dog, buddy, and bella"](unnamed-chunk-32-1.png)

Oops! Looks like a few of those are probably not real names. We'll go ahead and remove "dog", "null", "altered", "female", "male", "labrador", "retriever", "year", and "seattle" from the wordcloud.

``` r
# Remove non-names
names_2 <- tm_map(names, removeWords, c("dog", "null", "seattle", 
    "altered", "female", "male", "labrador", "retriever", "year"))

# Generate the wordcloud
wordcloud(names_2, scale = c(5, 0.2), max.words = 150, random.order = FALSE, 
    rot.per = 0.25, use.r.layout = TRUE, colors = brewer.pal(6, 
        "Greens")[c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)])
```

Wow! Lucy looks like the clear winner here!

Looks like some other well-known dog names (like Buddy) are pretty common in Seattle. How about "Rover"?

``` r
dogs_5 %>% filter(Name == "Rover")
```

There are 6 licensed dogs in Seattle named Rover!

Conclusions
-----------

* Dogs are basically everywhere in Seattle, but are most highly concentrated closer to the center of the city rather than on bordering neighborhoods.

* Regardless of apartment-living, Seattle-ites are big fans of big dogs throughout the city.

* The highest dog to human ratio is found in the Ballard to Crown Hill area, with nearly 1 dog per 10 people.

* Generally, Seattle would be a great place to be a dog sitter or walker. To increase the likelihood of finding customers, I'd suggest being open to walking or pet-sitting large dogs where possible.

* For a company like Rover.com which aims to connect dog-parents to dog sitters and walkers, I'd recommend providing this type of city-wide breakdown to potential sitters. I'd also suggest reaching out to large-dog owners to investigate their interest in becoming a sitter of other large dogs.

*Without both sitter and user data from Rover.com, I am unable to make recommendations regarding the best neighborhood to become a dog sitter.*
